# Usage: pfile expr [filenames]

# This program runs through all filenames provided either on the
# command line or piped through stdout and runs perl expression 'expr'
# on each file.  In 'expr', use '$_' as the wilcard referring to the
# current filename being processed.  If you're in the middle of an
# expression that's changing '$_' and decide to restore the old value
# of '$_', it is always stored in the variable '$was', which you can
# use in 'expr'.
#
# Examples
# --------
#
# List all filenames with extension "*.IMG" and containing the
# substring "RAD" or "RAL":
#
#     find /afs/ic-afs.arc.nasa.gov/mer-a/ -print | pfile \
#            'print $_ if /RAD.*IMG/ || /RAL.*IMG/'
#

($expr = shift) || die "Usage: pfile perl_expr [filenames]\n";

if (!@ARGV) {
   @ARGV = <STDIN>;
   chop(@ARGV);
}

for (@ARGV) {
   $was = $_;
   eval $expr;
   die $@ if $@;
}
